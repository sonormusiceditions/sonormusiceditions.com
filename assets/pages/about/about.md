# ABOUT US

Sonor Music Editions born in 2013 from an idea of Lorenzo Fabrizi, owner and founder of the label, that was one year later joined by his friend Andrea Galtieri. The label's name actually derives from the Italian term used to describe Library music, which is what the label focused on during its entire activity, which is "Sonorizzazioni". From rare and obscure Pop, Jazz, Cinematic Lounge, Funk, Easy Listening to underground Psychedelic, Sonor Music Editions dug into the deepest sounds of Italian Library and Soundtrack golden age, releasing and reissuing some of the most rare and beautiful recordings of this prolific music scene from 1970s/80s. In 2016 the label started to invest in the acquisition of original archival music, developing its own production library series with a nod to new, emerging and talented artists.
