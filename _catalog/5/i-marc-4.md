Originally released as G.L.P. 1004 on Nelson Records in 1970.

Another stunning gem by the Library 'cult' group I MARC 4. This is album is surely to be considered among their most Underground and Psychedelic works. A killer blend of Downtempo Funk, dope atmospheres and themes and Lounge-Bossa cocktail music. Includes fantastic tracks like "Distorsion-Mind" and "The Trip", heavy Psychedelic shots with screaming organ, "Compression" with mellow acoustic guitar and raw drums break plus other rare and mental tracks along with great samples and loops. Another sure I MARC 4 winner and essential Italian Library album!
