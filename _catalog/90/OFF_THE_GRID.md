The German guitarist, bandleader and soundscape architect JJ Whitefield has been an innovative force of the contemporary scene of Neo-Jazz-Kraut, and adjacent sub-genres within the world of organic grooves, ever since the early 1990s. The work with his group Poets of Rhythm drew the blueprint for what’s now known as retro-soul, and his creative canvas has never been blank since with numerous solo projects and collaborations across diverse constellations.

'Oﬀ The Grid' is yet another testament to JJ Whitefield’s creativity. The album perfectly connects the dots to the spirit of the golden age of library music waving together a rich tapestry of his world of playfulness, hypnotic grooves, and driving drums. It breathes new life into the genre while continuing to shape the future, as he has for over three decades.

Sonor Music Editions beautifully bridges the gap between the past and present, with this album, by featuring a original paintings by Italian artist Vivì as the cover art. Vivì is renowned for creating iconic covers for 1970s library releases such as Paolo Casa’s 'Nature' (Wild Cat – WC 114), 'Movimenti' (Full Records – FRLP 5099), and 'Origini' (Leo Records – LR 21), and Domenico Guaccero’s 'La Cattedrale del Benessere' (Abramo Allione – A.A. 1010), among others.
