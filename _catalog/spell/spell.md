We're pleased to announce the release of a previously totally unreleased Italian soundtrack on 45. Claudio Tallino "SPELL – DOLCE MATTATOIO" from 1977, originally composed for the censored erotic thriller movie directed by the visionary genius Alberto Cavallone. A shocking, freaking and occult storyline set in the province of Rome, scene of shady affairs and private dramas that protagonists try to hide behind a respectable front. Stunning and booming Italian OST production with 2 killer sleazy Funk shots selected from the original recording sessions.
