Maestro Bruno Zambrini's higher masterpiece and his favourite soundtrack originally recorded for the the TV series "RACCONTI DI MARE" in 1970, directed by Nestore Ungaro. Mental Vintage Underwater Score, one of the best from Library/Soundtrack music production. Music is a total trip with insane Psychedelic and Underground beats to die for, killer drum breaks, acquatic Lounge & Bossa themes and huge Underwater drama moods. The loungy atmospheres remind to sea trips nostalgia with the flowing sweet scat vocals broken by the spaced-out Underwater valtzs and marine vibes. Listening to "BEAT PSICHEDELICO" you'll get an epic theme as hell with a 5-minutes long totally badass Psychedelic beat, heavy orchestration filled unbelievable drum breaks, stop and go, and Psychedelic freak-out. The infectious "FORESTE DI CORALLO" with its Underwater Experimental interrupted refrain, the screamadelic organ and tense Underwater atmospherics of "AGGUATO SUL FONDO", "TENSIONE NEGLI ABISSI" and "RECUPERO IMPOSSIBILE" with more drumming beats on "DRAMMA A QUOTA -23". Amazing moody orchestrations with groovy Bossa and Easy Listening Lounge themes like "CROCIERA VERSO IL SUD" and the vintage nostalgia "RACCONTI DI MARE". TOP-NOTCH album, gloriously remastered from the original RCA STEREO master tapes and including a bonus CD with the complete unreleased MONO recording session featuring outtakes and alternative versions. Unmissable ITALIAN OST!
