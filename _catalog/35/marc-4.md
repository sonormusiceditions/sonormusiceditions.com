The toughest session by the great I MARC 4 Italian Jazz Library combo. Killer album and easily on the top 3 from the Nelson series with no weak tracks at all. The music goes from insane Psychedelic tunes to Jazz, Funk and more Bossa and Lounge tracks with plenty of Fuzz guitars, amazing Hammond job, and totally catching drum Breaks. An insane trip into early gold Italian Psychedelic and Underground vibes with loads of laden beats and grooves with the mark of the legendary Italian quartet. The whole record is simply amazing with killer Psychedelic B-boy Fuzz Funk / heavy stoned Hip-Hop beats / mental Fuzz Prog. Funk / groovy Funky Jazz tunes / hard-hitting drums / supreme breezy Bossa / groovy soulful midtempo Funk with dope Hammond Samba beats. Another essential jewel released on our label!
