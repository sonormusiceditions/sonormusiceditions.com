The Natural Yogurt Band, a mysterious and surprising music project arising from English countryside, has beautifully constructed a musical Parasol with this new album—not just a traditional sunshade, but a metaphorical shield (“para” in Latin) against visual dischord, noise, the ultra sonic spectrum, and generally all things unwanted.

Parasol, composed by Miles Newbold—one of the most unique and fascinating figures in the contemporary neo-library psychedelic jazz fusion scene—was recorded in rural Derbyshire, nestled between hills and trees. The result is unmistakably singular, carrying The Natural Yogurt Band’s wild yet perfectly balanced signature sound: raw-edged compositions, solid but fragile textures, and heavy drum. All of it is framed by Newbold’s exceptional and uncompromising production style, which functions, fittingly, as a parasol—a protective barrier against the modern world’s relentless disturbances.

Sonor Music Editions beautifully bridges the gap between the past and present, with this album, by featuring an original paintings by Italian artist Vivì as the cover art. Vivì is renowned for creating iconic covers for 1970s library releases such as Paolo Casa’s Nature (Wild Cat – WC 114), Movimenti (Full Records – FRLP 5099), and Origini (Leo Records – LR 21), and Domenico Guaccero’s La Cattedrale del Benessere (Abramo Allione –
A.A. 1010), among others.
