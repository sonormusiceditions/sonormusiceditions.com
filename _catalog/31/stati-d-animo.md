"STATI D'ANIMO vol.2" aka FEELING originally released on CAM CmL series in 1973. Music here is almost for sure by the same session men behind the "THE FINE MACHINE - HABITAT" LP and other delights released under the same nickname. The jam featured Nico Fidenco (Donimak), Giacomo & Gianni Dell'Orso (Oscar Lindok / Proluton) and other obscure musicians. Tracks appear signed by Donimak (Fidenco's alias), Tamborelli (standing for Aldo Tamborrelli aka Ghein), and the mysterious Nicoletta Bozzai behind the pseudonym 'Morfina'. A totally KILLER Italian Library album with the most outstanding Funk & Jazz-Funk vibes and female vocals to die for, knitted drum patterns and top-notch Vintage dancefloor Funk tunes ever. Moody & Funky Score music for action, movement and romantic scenes. Some of the real best came out from Italy!
