Collection of Maestro Sandro Brugnolini's rare unreleased music production themes composed between late '80s and early '90s. Genuine and brilliant Electronic and Ambient music by the cult Italian Jazz maestro produced for TV background use and synchronization.


"Mood is the feeling that the listener gets from music. Atmosphere is the mix of emotions and feelings created from the music. Electronics the greatest common divisor for Sandro Brugnolini. The two terms are blend together in a collection of contemporary sounds entitled “Electronic Moods And Atmospheres” (2018), compiled by Lorenzo Fabrizi. There's however a real difference in terminology for the Roman composer, member of the Modern Jazz Gang and responsible for cult Italian Soundtracks like "Gli Arcangeli” (1962), “Fantabulous” (1967) and “Gungala La Pantera Nuda” (1968). This set of unreleased tracks was originally conceived more than twenty years ago, at the end of the golden age of Italian artists lent to the 7th art, when great orchestras gave the way to electronic instruments. Musical experiments charactherized by great intensity and suspense, perfect to be the scored in some weird thriller movie sequences, and joined to some Smooth Jazz memoirs filtered with the computer and other melodic, or sometimes nostalgic, early video games tune. The majority of the tracks here is not only combined by the use of a new generation instrumentation but, above all, a certain underlying rhythm, in line with the aesthetic standards of the end of the millennium. Listening then to Burnejones 1 and Burnejones 2 you can learn about how a saxophone player can become a true master with synthesizers." - Marco Ferretti
