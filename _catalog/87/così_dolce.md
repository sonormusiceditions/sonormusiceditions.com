Sonor Music Editions is happy to announce the vinyl reissue of Riz Ortolani's iconic soundtrack to the 1969 Giallo thriller "Così Dolce... Così Perversa" (So Sweet, So Perverse). This highly sought-after score composed by the legendary maestro who scored over 200 films, including Paolo Cavara and Gualtiero Jacopetti's 1962 pseudo-documentary "Mondo Cane," perfectly captures the atmosphere of suspense, eroticism, and deception found in this obscure film.

Directed by Umberto Lenzi and starring Carroll Baker and Jean-Louis Trintignant, "Così Dolce... Così Perversa" is a stylish and thrilling masterpiece from the golden era of Italian Giallo films. Ortolani's score is a crucial element in the film's success, featuring haunting melodies, driving rhythms, and the unforgettable main theme, "Why?" sung by British singer J. Vincent Edwards, with lyrics by Norman Newell.

Twenty-four years after its initial vinyl release, this lost Italian soundtrack has been revitalized with fully remastered sound sourced from the original master tapes from the legendary Sermi Records vaults. This new reissue is available in a limited edition of 500 copies and mark the first ever digital release of the soundtrack.
