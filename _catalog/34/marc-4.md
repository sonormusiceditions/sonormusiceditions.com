The first volume from the Nelson Records series by the infamous Italian Jazz quartet composed of Maurizio Majorana on the bass (M), Antonello Vannucchi at the organ (A), Roberto Podio at the drums (R), and Carlo Pes (C) on the bass. Seminal, deeply Underground session by the legendary Italian Library studio combo with tones of sleazy sounds starting from the Psychedelic guitar riffs, the crazy tough Funk and the groovy sharped beats to the lovely Jazz arranged theme music influenced by Samba, Bossa Nova and Easy Listening vibes of the time. I Marc 4 provided some of the best cinematic and theme music of the time, and this is one of their deepest productions. Top Italian Library LP production and unmissable piece for collectors of the genre!
