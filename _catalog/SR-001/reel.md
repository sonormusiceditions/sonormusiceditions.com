The first compilation ever of the historical SR Records, label of Sermi Film publishing, active in Italy from 1967 to circa 1974.

We're excited to announce the release of "SR Record" on a very special format - a tribute to the golden analog days of the Italian Library and Soundtrack era with a selection of the best tracks from one of the most important label of the field. The name SERMI was born from the union of the founders, Sergio Pagoni and Michelangelo Cunsolo (SER-MI) that partnered at the beginning of 1970s with Bruno Nicolai, Morriconeâ€™s music director and owner of Gemelli label. Sergio would later start Cometa together with Ivana Mattei in 1976, while Maestro Bruno Nicolai would later found his Edipan label in 1975. Sermi Records undoubtedly played a key role in the history of Italian Library productions being among the very first labels to invest in the music production for television, then disbanded in 1976 with the split into 3 separate companies, Cometa-Sermi-Gemelli.

30 tracks digitally remastered and restored from the original Sermi vaults and released on a super limited reel, pressed on 15 copies only, all handmade and hand numbered.
