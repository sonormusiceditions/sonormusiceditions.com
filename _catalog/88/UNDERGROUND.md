In 1970, Italian composer Sandro Brugnolini recorded the two psychedelic lounge masterpieces Overground and Underground at Dirmaphon Studios in Rome. Featuring a lineup of some of Italy’s finest musicians—Silvano Chimenti (guitar), Angelo Baroncini (guitar), Giorgio Carnini (organ and piano), Giovanni Tommaso (bass and effects), and Enzo Restuccia (drums)—these sessions were deeply rooted in the late 1960s psychedelic sound but uniquely fused jazz improvisation, funk, and Latin and African rhythms with cinematic melodies. This fusion defines their distinctive character and cements them as two of Brugnolini’s most impressive works, remaining among the most sought-after artifacts from the golden era of Italian library music.

Overground—which we reissued in 2024—was originally released as the soundtrack to Persuasione, a documentary commissioned by Ente Provinciale Per Il Turismo Di Trento. Meanwhile, Underground was issued in two separate releases, RT 104 and RT 16, on the library and soundtrack label Record TV Discografica, founded by Alessandro Derevitzky in the late 1950s. In 2014, Sonor Music Editions compiled both versions for Underground's first-ever reissue (SME 3), featuring the longer version of ”Psichefreèlico" from RT 16, instead of the shorter ”Sostenuto” and ”Ballata" versions from RT 104, along with new artwork.

Now, in this 2025 reissue, Underground returns in its original RT 104 attire, with its original track listing and artwork. Sourced and carefully remastered from the original mono tapes and lacquer cut by Jukka Sarapää at Timmion Cutting, this edition features carefully restored Record TV Discografica label design artwork, printed on high-quality card stock. Limited to 500 copies.
