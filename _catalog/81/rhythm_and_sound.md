Sonor Music Editions proudly announces a previously unknown Italian Library killer session from the golden era - RHYTHM AND SOUND by the mysterious 'Mandrassi & Zollinger', backed by 'I Beati' studio band. Mandrassi, alias for Anna Maria Assunta Andreassi, is one of the very first female composers of Library Music in Italy while Zollinger is linked to Sergio Pagano, brother of the famed Italian author, composer and singer Mario Pagano. Originally released in 1974 for the private studio label ‘Ludo Record’, this album remained in the obscurity for almost 50 years, it’s so rare that only very few hardcore record collectors know it, we even doubt about its existence at all.. so we're now glad to bring it back to life!

A countless breaks galore, filled with outstanding funk grooves and chasing beats. The jam sounds like a missing link between The Fine Machine ‘Habitat’ and the legendary Arawak ‘Accadde a..’ recordings, with its uptempo rhythms allover and the coolest funky instrumentation played by a mysterious studio group.
