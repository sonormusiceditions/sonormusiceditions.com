This exceptionally rare library album by Italian composer, musician, and guitarist Mario Molino was first released on the obscure library music imprint B.M.P. during the 1970s. It was later issued on the highly collectible Music Scene label rebranded as Action Beat Group (MSE-144), featuring different track titles and attributed to the pseudonym Luigi Ferracioli.

Although much about him remains unknown to this day, Mario Molino was a prominent figure in the world library music, celebrated for his genre-spanning versatility. On one hand, he was a virtuoso classical guitarist, while on the other, he had a strong foundation in jazz and contemporary music. This duality, spanning from classical guitar solos to spaced out psychedelic rock with fuzzed guitars, eccentric funk-infused Hammond organ grooves, proto-hip hop, and orchestral compositions, is reflected in his discography. His catalog includes rare and sought-after releases like Antico e Moderno (C 364) on Fonit's Usignolo series, Love on Vroommm Records, Beat Gregoriano on Montecarlo, I Beats on Pentaphon, alongside numerous library and soundtracks releases.

The Diamonds Four stands as a hidden gem in Molino's oeuvre, seamlessly aligning with his best releases, as it contains a superb blend of groovy psychedelic funk, breezy bossa nova, killer jazz beat tunes and expansive mood-music. With only a handful of original pressings ever surfacing over the years, The Diamonds Four (as well as the later issue as Action Beat Group) earned its status as a unique and widely valued record among library and soundtrack enthusiasts worldwide.
