Mark Saddlemire is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer from Philadelphia, passionate about creating instrumental compositions from a blend of acoustical and electronic sounds using analog techniques. An electrical engineer by trade, he's customized and repaired much of the vintage gear used for his recordings - his studio is a collection of unique and rare analog instruments from the 1960s to the 1980s. He uses Ampex and Electrodyne Preamps, Beyerdynamic Electrovoice and Coles microphones, Universal Audio LA-2A and 1176, Custom Vari-mu compression and passive EQ, Revox and TEAC tape machines. His synthesizers include classic vintage units from Moog, Korg, and Roland.

We're presenting under our New Tape label Mark's debut release "Sound-In-The-Round", that draws a deep inspiraton by the golden era of Italian Library and Soundtrack Music. Something akin to the legendary Prog-Rock ensemble Goblin and the avant-garde composer Giuliano Sorgini, but with a rich plenty of grooveness.
