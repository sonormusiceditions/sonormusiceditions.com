Maestro Paolo Ormi was a great arranger and orchestra director for the Italian television of the 1970s/80s that strictly worked with many important international artists and that's largely remembered for being the personal Raffaella Carra and Rita Pavone's arranger and conductor for a large part of his career. Beyond his contribution and work for the Italian famed singers, he delighted himself in producing some gorgeous Latin Funk albums, often covering and re-arranging Latin music classics.

Sonor team was able to rescue from oblivion the lost tapes of this incredible recording, that were originally conceived in 1972 at RCA studios in Rome, and until now never officially released on any commercial/physical format. A promo Stereo-8 was only issued at the time on a ridiculous run, and only distributed for non-commercial purposes among the TV circuits. The album is a really special Latin-Funk banger that anticipates "P.O.X. SOUND vol.2" LP, issued in 1973, and clearly shows Maestro Ormi's strong Latin-influenced take on music with tones of groovy Latin Jazz, exciting breaks and hot Latin Funk groovers. Fabulous album from start to finish!
