Amazing Italian Library Electronic and Underwater gem remained totally obscure till these days and absolutely impossible to find! - Originally released in 1974 at Amedeo Tommasi's own studio - music is signed by Tommasi under his monikers Atmo/Jarrell, Leandro Piccioni and Umberto Santucci aka Montedoro. Bewitching Underwater music trip made through analogue synthesizers and sophisticated Electronic Lounge mood music especially recorded for TV sea documentaries - for sure one of the finest examples we had of Italian Underwater Library music. Delicated marine themes are alternated by hypnotic and abyssal vibes with droning effects, but generally the sound is driven by soft and loungy atmospheres; elegance reflected in crystal clear waves. Little jewel for fans of early Electronic music and Library junkies.
