The latest album by the legendary Italian Jazz Sax player ENZO SCOPPA and the first CD ever released on our label. "NEW & OLD FRIENDS" featuring the famed and timeless duo SANTUCCI-SCOPPA active since 1958, is a modern Jazz work and interpretation of BeBop, Big Band and Contemporary Jazz with Sestetto, Quintetto and Orchestra accompaniment. Alongside Basso-Valdambrini Sextet, the Santucci-Scoppa Quintet is the most ancient and solid ensemble in the history of Italian Jazz. On this refined Jam session every performance is perfectly executed always with an high quality, thanks to the skill of talented musicians like the great arranger Antonello Sorrentino, the legendary trumpeter Cicci Santucci and the expert drummer Pietro Iodice. Adriano Mazzoletti's liner notes contained in the booklet add the jewel in the crown.
