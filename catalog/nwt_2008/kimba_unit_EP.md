Now Again Records and Sonor Music Editions announce the debut release by The Kimba Unit on 45. Grown up in Los Angeles, Julian Rapaport made his musical studies in New York, developing his personal musical taste listening to the Jazz mentors of American Spiritual/Avant-garde movement (Sun Ra especially). Legendary Madlib’s jazz projects influenced him a lot too. Since his very young age, he had a deep connection with Italy and the world of Italian Library music: renowned Italian composers like Piero Umiliani and Piero Piccioni definitely completed and surely influenced his musical background. The 3 tracks from this EP are entirely DIY studio recordings, with a distinct Lo-Fi sound and shades of Spiritual Jazz all over.
